# My Red Team Scripts

A collection of automated scripts designed for ethical red team exercises, lab environments, and personal learning projects. Each script has its own folder with a dedicated README containing usage instructions and details.

## Notes

- These scripts are intended for **ethical use only** in controlled environments or with explicit permission.  
- Always verify firewall rules, DNS settings, and dependencies before running the scripts.  
- Each script can be run independently and has its own configuration options.   - Inspired by Tyler Ramsbey, during his Hands-On Phishing, which I recommend EVERYONE take the course its great.

## Portfolio / Showcase

This repository demonstrates my ability to:  

- Automate deployment of red team tools on VPS environments.  
- Integrate tools like Evilginx and GoPhish in a repeatable workflow.  
- Write clear documentation and provide modular, reusable scripts.
